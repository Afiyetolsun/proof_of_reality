# Deploy the OAK host-side bits.
#
# Two modes:
#
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh
#     One-shot setup: bring up usb0 and start the forwarder for this
#     boot only. Goes away on reboot. Good for first-time testing.
#
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh --systemd
#     Install the forwarder as a systemd service (oak-gotee.service)
#     that auto-starts on boot, auto-restarts on failure, and is bound
#     to the cdc_ether usb0 device so it follows the Armory in/out.
#     Recommended for any persistent setup.
#
# Env:
#   OAK_IP   IP of the OAK4 (default 192.168.88.236)
